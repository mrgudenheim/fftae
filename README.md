# About
This tool streamlines creating xml patches for FFT that edit animations.

# Features
- Change opcodes and parameters
- Insert and delete opcodes
- Create SEQ or xml patch

# Limitations and Notes
Some animation pointers point to the same animation, but that is not reflected in what this tool displays. When editing an animation that is in multiple slots, make sure you are editing the last slot it appears in.

# Future Improvements
- Improve UI
- Add and Remove animations
- Preview animations by allowing user to load spritesheet and SHP

# Building From Source
This project is built with Godot 4.3
