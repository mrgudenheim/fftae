# About
This tool streamlines creating xml patches for FFT that edit animations.

# Limitations and Notes
Some animation pointers point to the same animation, but that is not reflected in what this tool displays. When editing an animation that is in multiple slots, make sure you are editing the last slot it appears in.

# Building From Source
